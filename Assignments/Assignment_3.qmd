On the website of the New York Times: <https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/28/us/covid-deaths.html?referrer=masthead>

```{r}
rm (list = ls())
library(tidyverse)

library(janitor) 
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(jsonlite)
```

```{r}
df <-fromJSON("https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2021/12/20/us-coronavirus-deaths-2021/ff0adde21623e111d8ce103fedecf7ffc7906264/scatter.json")
